# leetcode-comparator

I created LeetCode Comparator to visualize bars to compare 2 LeetCode Profiles by entering usernames basis on Problems (Easy, Medium, Hard), Global Ranking and Acceptance Rate. 

LeetCode Comparator uses an LeetCode Stats API to get the user’s data from their LeetCode Account and then by both user’s data, the bars will be created that can be visualized.
